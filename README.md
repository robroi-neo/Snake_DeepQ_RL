# Snake Game Using DeepQ Learning

## Comments
Currently just a copied version from the tutorial I have watched. - robroi

## To do
- Implement or Modify features outside of the scope of the tutorial.


Features to implement or Consider:
    - Store every new "milestone" for the model (i.e. probably a new high score)
    - Consider: Add Walls or bigger food (bigger score the faster you eat it)
    - Add GUI Elements to make it pretty looking.
    - Package into a desktop application.
