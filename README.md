# Snake Game Using Deep Q-Learning

## Summary
This project is currently a direct implementation based on a tutorial previously followed.  
— Robroi

## Objectives
Enhance or extend the project beyond the scope of the original tutorial by introducing additional features and improvements.

### Planned Features
- Save each new training milestone (e.g., when the model reaches a new high score).
- Potential gameplay modifications:
  - Add walls or obstacles.
  - Introduce alternative food types (e.g., larger items with higher score rewards for faster consumption).
- Improve the graphical user interface (GUI) for a more polished presentation.
- Package the project as a standalone desktop application.
